          Let's go to the kickoff. More football than JAKO is not possible. From
          the boss and founder of the company to the storage staff, everyone at
          JAKO is crazy about football. The JAKO range in the online shop also
          shows this: jerseys, sports shorts, socks, sports bags and everything
          for the goalkeeper - here really everyone can put together his outfit
          for training and play. The impressive thing is that all articles are
          available in many different variations with different designs and in
          numerous colours. The special clothing is not only available for men
          and children but also in extra cuts for the ladies. With outstanding,
          functional properties. Where football rolls, JAKO is not far away.
          From the Bundesliga to the Kreisliga, the football teams wear the logo
          with the two rivers on their chest. Everyone appreciates the quality
          of the jerseys, socks and sports shorts. JAKO jerseys stand for
          first-class functionality. The KEEP DRY function optimally regulates
          the body climate. Comfortable interlock fabrics are particularly
          breathable and quick-drying. Jacquard fabrics and mesh inserts with
          their open fabric structure transport moisture directly away from the
          body to the outside. Thanks to this function, the soccer player
          remains dry and, thanks to the regulated body climate, performs better
          for longer. But it's not just the function that makes JAKO jerseys the
          absolute highlight for all skystormers and ball distributors. The
          unique selection in the online shop of jerseys, sports shorts, socks,
          sports bags and hardware is what inspires all JAKO fans. Whether
          fashionable designer shirt, traditional block stripes or classic uni
          jersey, everything is available in the JAKO jersey collection and the
          online shop.
